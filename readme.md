 ## CURRENT RELEASE

The most recent version of AutoPrimer3 is AutoPrimer3A, written and Copyrighted by David A. Parry and edited and revised by Bert Gold during the Summer 2024.  This version fixes issues arising from UCSC's recent update to their genome metadata that stopped previous versions from working. The portion of the program that permits specifying gene names for targets when designing targets is not working at this time (August 20, 2024), nor are icons being properly packaged with the executable.  Both of these "features" or "bugs" are under active investigation and repair by Bert Gold

# AutoPrimer3

AutoPrimer3 retrieves gene information, DNA sequences and SNP information from the [UCSC genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and uses [primer3](http://primer3.sourceforge.net/) to automatically design primers to genes or genomic coordinate targets. 

Primers may be designed using information from any of the UCSC hosted genomes and primers can be made to avoid overlapping SNPs for genomes where SNP databases are available. 

An instructions PDF can be viewed by selecting the 'Help' menu item from the application or by visiting [here](https://github.com/bgold04/AutoPrimer3A/notes/instructions.pdf).
